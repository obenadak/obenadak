# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm someone who enjoys turning ideas into working systems: whether it's a web application, a machine learning model, or an embedded IoT prototype. I'm especially interested in combining software and hardware to build smart, data-driven solutions.

## ðŸ§  Areas of Interest

- **Artificial Intelligence:**  
  I'm passionate about building intelligent systems using machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. I work on tasks like classification, regression, image recognition, and text understanding - often experimenting with real-world datasets and modern libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.

- **Web Development:**  
  Experienced with both backend and frontend tools - from simple HTML/CSS sites to dynamic apps using frameworks like AngularJS, ASP.NET Core, and PHP.

- **Embedded & IoT Projects:**  
  I enjoy building real-time applications using microcontrollers like **ESP32**, **Arduino Uno**, and **Raspberry Pi Pico** - especially for environmental monitoring and smart control systems.

- **Software Design & Architecture:**  
  Familiar with OOP principles, the MVC pattern, and Git. I care about writing modular, maintainable code.

- **Web3 & Decentralized Tech:**  
  Currently learning and experimenting with Web3 technologies to better understand decentralized applications and smart contracts.

## ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™m Currently Exploring

- Enhancing frontend UX with modern design techniques  
- Building API-integrated React apps  
- Developing smarter IoT systems with sensor data  
- Training NLP models and fine-tuning transformers  
- Diving into the Web3 ecosystem and smart contract development
